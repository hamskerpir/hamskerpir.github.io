FastAPI is my main REST API framework, flask is more a have-to-maintain legacy framework for me, so further in this
document I will focus on FastAPI.

I think it has very powerful dependency injection and plugin system, good performance, and great community support, so
there
is not much unknown unknows when working with it.

# Seznam.cz

___

- <i>Rewrote custom-daemon framework to FastAPI + FastStream</i>, which resulted in <b>improved reliability to 0
  incidents/week on average</b> and
  <b>reduced manual interactions</b> with service.

# Enverus

___

- I <i>was lobbying a FastAPI</i> as framework for new services, that <b>saved a development time</b> and made
  developers happier, adding a strong documentation layer with OpenAPI out-of-the-box.
